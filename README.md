# Modernipsum

An art-themed lorem ipsum generator inspired by artistic movements and terminology.

## Overview

Modernipsum is a PHP-based web application that generates placeholder text using art-related terms and artistic movements instead of traditional Latin lorem ipsum text. The project is described by its creators as "a blatant rip of a rip of Bacon Ipsum" but with an artistic twist.

## Features

- **Art-themed placeholder text**: Generates lorem ipsum text using artistic movements, styles, and terminology
- **Simple web interface**: Clean, modern design with a single-click generation button
- **About page**: Information about the project and its creators
- **Responsive design**: Works across different screen sizes

## Files

- `index.php` - Main application file with routing and page layout
- `home.php` - Homepage with the text generator functionality
- `corpus.txt` - Text corpus containing art-related terms and movements
- `background_modernipsum.png` - Header background image

## How it works

The generator randomly combines art terminology from the corpus file to create pseudo-Latin text that resembles traditional lorem ipsum but incorporates artistic movements and styles like "abstract expressionism", "art deco", "avant-garde", etc.
